												See my <a href="#products" class="active">Products Portfolio</a> below for more details.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Excel Insight:</b> 
												 Datasmith have an Excel plugin product called Excel Insight, which allows customers to query account data from Microsoft Great Plains from within their spreadsheet in order to calculate their general ledgers. This is performed via Excel UDFs (User Designed Functions). The original product was developed using VBScript by one of the co-founders and Technical Director of Datasmith. Since he was no longer with the company I was tasked with architecting and redeveloping the product using .NET and C#. This is a reasonably large product being made up of several components including web services, configurators and the plugin itself. Features are also available
												for customers to design/customise their Excel Insight functions within Excel. All standard database queries using LINQ-to-SQL and custom queries using stored procedures. Some of our customers include Burger King, Digistics, RCS, Old Mutual and many others. The development has been part of an R&D endeavour.
												See my <a href="#products" class="active">Products Portfolio</a> below for more details.

												<b>Voice/Speech Development:</b> 
												See our Datasmith Warehousing Solutions presentation here: <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/paulkolozsvari/datasmith-warehousing-solutions-88529260">Datasmith Warehousing Solutions</a>
												Pigeon Voice Server: due to Zebra and Vocollect (owned by Honeywell)
												becoming direct competitors, our customers were hesitant to use Zebra's TekSpeech middleware product to enable integrations between Vocollect voice applications and their WMS (Warehouse Management System). Zebra ultimately discontinued the TekSpeech product range. I suggested and convinced one of our voice customers to take on an R&D endeavour by developing and providing them with our own middleware server to replace TekSpeech. Pigeon Voice Server is now our own white label middleware product that I personally designed and developed and have now implemented at all of our clients' voice sites around the country. It works
												with Honeywell Vocollect's proprietary messages types (LUT & ODR) over TCP/IP as well as over HTTP by providing a REST web service for the voice applications to consume.
												Pigeon Voice Website: developed a dashboard website in ASP.NET MVC to view statistics, devices and operators connecting as well as logs of every transaction going through the middleware.

										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Projects</b>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<b>Digistics Store Delivery:</b> 
												This is precursor to the NTrack EPOD product.
												I designed, developed and project managed an EPOD (Electronic Proof of Delivery) / Route Execution system for store deliveries. 
												I developed the entire system from scratch. See mobile app documentation here: 
												<br>
												<a href="https://github.com/DatasmithSA/Digistics-SD-Android-Help/wiki">Digistic Store Delivery Documentation</a>
												See my <a href="#products" class="active">Products Portfolio</a> below for more details.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Digistics Voice:</b> 
												Digistics handles all the logistics for McDonalds, KFC, Pizza Hut and many other QSR chainstore restaurants in South Africa: I developed their voice directed system using Vocollect products and technology stack and our Pigeon middleware. Digistics is the only company in South Africa to have a voice implementation in processes across
												all their Distribution Centres i.e. receiving, put away, replenishment and picking. See case study video here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQjHkDefIyc"> Vocollect Digistics Case Study Video</a>. We later converted the solution back to Vocollect hardware and software and rolled out the solution to 8 Digistics Distribution Centres across South Africa. On average, the system generates 250 000 database entries (request & responses) a day per warehouse.
												<br>
												<a href="http://youtu.be/A0IKH9NwhNY">Digistics Voice Case Study Video</a>
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Pep Stores Voice:</b> 
												I initially developed their speech picking solution in 2012 while working for Psion and through a personal long standing and very good relationship with them, they made Datasmith their Vocollect Voice partner. I upgraded them to the
												latest technology stack (hardware + software) in their 4 warehouses across the country and redeveloped their voice picking solution against Vocollect's latest voice engine (Voice Catalyst). The Voice application on the device was coded in Python and server- side custom Pigeon Voice Agents (plugins) were coded in C# for the integration into Pep's Oracle based WMS. On average, the system generates 1 million database entries (request & responses) a day per warehouse.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Moresport (Sportsmans Warehouse) Voice:</b> 
												Designed, developed and project managed a voice picking solution for Moresport i.e. holding company for Sportsmans Warehouse and Outdoor Warehouse. I developed the solution design, the integration between the voice app and their Cquential WMS and oversaw the development of the voice app running on the device
												i.e. I managed the developer working on the device voice app.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Innervation:</b> 
												Designed and developed a middleware solution between the Micros POS (Point Of Sale) systems and Innervation to handle credit card payments via a PED device. The middleware handles sale, refund and reversal credit card transactions between Micros and a Innervation SOAP Service.
												The middleware was used at all Nandos restaurants in South Africa that are using Micros and Innervation for capturing credit card payments.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Sanlam TouchBuy:</b> 
												Developed a mobile application (on .NET Compact Framework 3.5 and C#) and web application (ASP.NET MVC) allowing Sanlam employees to pay within the Sanlam shops (e.g. cafeteria) using their existing employee proximity cards (RFID).
												I did the tender proposal, complete analysis, research of hardware
												required, procurement, quoting, ordering, project management and software development, as well as integration & testing etc. Integration with Sanlam HR system was developed using FTP and flat files as per their requirements. Mobile to server integration via WCF REST web service. Integrations to Sanlam's access control system was done via SOAP services flat files via FTP.
												See my <a href="#products" class="active">Products Portfolio</a> below for more details.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Toad NUTS:</b> 
												Developed an Android app (using C# and Xamarin) and web application (ASP.NET MVC) for an organization called Toad NUTS that focus on the conservation of the endangered Western Leopard Toad. The Android application enables the capturing of pictures and information (including GPS co-ordinates) of Western Leopard Toad sightings while the web application displays the captured data, creates statistics reports and plots sightings on a Google Map. Additional features include the ability to setup areas by drawing polygons on Google Maps thereby enabling the system to automatically calculate and allocated toad sightings to specific areas. 
												See my <a href="#products" class="active">Products Portfolio</a> below for more details.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Pigeon B2B:</b> 
												Developed a middleware solution for integrating Micros (Point of Sale) with Microsoft Great Plains (used by Dunkin Donuts Logistics) and a custom SAP backend via web services (used by Vector Logistics for Burger King). Integration between Micros and Pigeon is via flat files and FTP, while logistics companies can integrate via stored procedures as well as WCF REST and SOAP services. The middleware handles orders, invoices and product catalog between the Point of Sale system and logistics companies, with email alerts and various business rules in place etc. 
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Fixers:</b> 
												Developed an Android mobile app solution for Total and BP petrol pump technicians to capture their forms on an Android tablet. Android app is
												integrated with Odoo ERP system via web services. Android app was developed in C# using Xamarin, SQLite database on the device and a WCF REST web service coded in C# on the middleware for integrating into Odoo. Integration into Odoo was achieved through XML RPC where I had to develop an Odoo XML RPC adapter for .NET.
												<a href="https://github.com/PaulKolozsvari/Odoo.XmlRpcAdapter.NET">Odoo XML RPC Adapter Repo</a>
												My responsibility in this project was designing the technical architecture, project management and software development lead on both the Android app and web services. My colleagues in India and Canada implemented the Odoo ERP system and customisation.

												<b>Psion Africa Web Site</b> Due to us not having sufficient information about our local subsidiary online, I put up a web site for us. The web site was online for over a year until corporate policy dictated that we should only have a single web site world wide. Before it was taken offline, the www.psionafrica.co.za web site consisted of product catalogs, blogs, forums, surveys, downloads area etc. As part of this initiative I created surveys to be sent out to customers.

									<h4>Agilisto</h3>
									<h4>Oct 2008 - Aug 2009 : Project Manager</h4>
									<p>
										<b>Company Profile:</b> Agilisto was a software development consulting company, which mainly focused on web solutions, mobile applications and location based solutions.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Work Summary:</b>
										Majority of my work involved developing mobile applications and consulting with customers.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Projects:</b>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<b>Road defect info capturing mobile application</b> 
												In the mining industry, due the large size of the trucks being used, the ability to capture information regarding the state of roads
												 is critical i.e. based on the number of faults on the roads and their severity one can calculate the petrol consumption 
												 (as well as other factors) and therefore the amount of money lost due to the existance of the faults. We had a solution that allows users to capture defects on the roads and their GPS co-ordinates via a Microsoft .NET Compact Framework based application. Defects are then synchronized with the mobile application server using the Microsoft Synchronization Services for ADO.NET. An ASP.NET web application performs calculations on the captured data and displays the results as well as plots the defects on a map. I was involved in the development of the mobile application and some of the code required to implement the synchronization services.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Freight/Courier mobile applications</b> 
												We in partnership with various other companies have developed several .NET Compact Framework based applications designed to meet the needs of the freight and courier industries. 
												These applications allow our clients to give their drivers specific tasks to be completed throughout the day. 
												The applications were built using iTask; a Sybase workflow framework built on top of the Microsoft .NET Compact Framework. 
												A Microsoft SQL Server database was used on the mobile application server. The iTask mobile application utilized Sybase's UltraLite database on the device. Synchronization between the devices and server was handled with the aid of Sybase's MobiLink. I was involved in building a few of the task types on the mobile application, as well assisting in the development of the integration layer between our clients and our mobile application server.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Selling of Electricity mobile application</b> 
												An electricity company in northern Africa had a prepaid system that allows users to recharge their given smartcards with electricity. We had been in the process of developing a mobile solution that would allow operators to sell electricity from a mobile device. We have developed a .NET Compact Framework mobile application that allows a user to insert a smartcard into a Windows Mobile device and recharge the card with credits. All communication between the device and our mobile application server is handled via web services. I developed the mobile application. Furthermore, to enhance the appearance of the mobile UI, I developed a framework centered around the idea of animated sheets i.e. where a sheet corresponds to a form. Utilizing the framework simply involves adding sheets and thereafter controls on the sheets. Requesting a sheet to open or close results in the sheet and its controls to be moved on and off the screen.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>VanSales / SFA (Sales Force Automation mobile application</b> 
												We were in the process of developing a .NET Compact Framework application that allows sales representatives to sell products from a vehicle. The user has the option to sell, thereby create an invoice based on the items available in his/her inventory or alternatively create an order based on a product catalog. All relevant data is synchronized with the mobile application server running Microsoft SQL Server via the Microsoft Synchronization Services for ADO.NET. All data on our server was synchronized with Pastel Evolution on the client's server. I have assisted in creating the specification for the solution, developing the mobile application, designing and implementing the Microsoft SQL Server database on our mobile application server and implementing the sync services.

									<!-- Red Five Labs -->
									<h4>Red Five Labs</h3>
									<h4>Feb 2007 - Sep 2008 : Software Engineer</h4>
									<p>
										<b>Company Profile:</b> 
										Red Five Labs were developing a product called Net60, which was a .NET Compact Framework implementation for Symbian, S60 3rd Edition mobile devices This enables applications targeting the Microsoft .NET Compact Framework to run unchanged on mobile phones running the Symbian operating system. Projects and work I was involved in:
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Work Summary:</b>
										Developed a lot of the internal tools, development of our company website and integrations into sales force, as well as acting as the build master.
										I was involved in testing our prior CTP and Beta releases. Additional testing that I carried out included the development of simple POC's of several popular mobile DBMS's, such as IBM DB2 Everyplace, Sybase SQL Anywhere 10 (for Windows Mobile), Microsoft SQL Server CE and db40 6.4 (.NET1). The purpose of this investigation was to determine which of these DBMS's are supported by our product Net60.
										I was assigned Build Master and therefore was responsible for general maintenance of the build server, which ran Cruise Control .NET. My duties included diagnosing broken builds, reorganizing build projects and modifying NAnt scripts, ensuring daily test runs ran correctly and troubleshooted any broken builds and test runs.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Internal Tools Development:</b>
										with some guidance from my CTO at the time I designed and developed the following tools that are used to perform additional profiling and coverage analysis on our test results. The majority of these tools were executed from NAnt scripts. While our runtime executed and JIT compiled an application it also loged major events into a binary log file. This file is parsed using our Log Viewer tool. The Log Viewer also generates some useful profiling information based on the parsed data and therefore almost all of the following tools that I have developed are dependant on the Log Viewer:
										<ul>
											<li>
												<b>ProfileWriter: </b> 
												Searched through directories for log files and parses them to generate the profiling data. This data is then written to either an XML file corresponding to each log file or the entire merged data is written to a Microsoft SQL Server database.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>ProfileNotifier: </b> 
												Retrieves profiling data and notifies team of test run result.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>ProfileXmlMerger</b> 
												Searches a directory for the above mentioned XML files and then parses and merges their contents into a single XML file.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>CLI Tests web site</b> 
												An ASP.NET, AJAX enabled, web page that retrieves and displays the profiling data. This web-page also generates and displays graphs that illustrate the performance of our product over time i.e. based on the profiling information.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>DeltaGen</b> 
												A simple tool for generating a delta between the last and penultimate test run and thereafter emailed the results. The results include percentages of passing tests, as well as a list of newly passing/failing tests, previously passing failing tests and previously failing passing tests.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>CovAn:</b> 
												A set of tools that utilize the profiling data from the database to compile a list of methods that were executed on the last test run and compare this list with a list of methods that exist in our assemblies, which is compiled using Mono.Cecil. This comparison then constitutes our code coverage i.e. which methods are being covered by tests and which are not. An additional tool performs a coverage progress analysis by comparing our coverage results between any two given test runs and determining our velocity (methods/day).
											</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Projects:</b>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<b>Application server:</b> 
												I was responsible for maintaining all of our internal web-sites and databases on our application server i.e. blog, profiling, wiki etc.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>2ME performance test application:</b> 
												I developed a simple multi-threaded J2ME application, that utilizes J2ME's File.Connection API. Its purpose was to compare its performance to an equivalent application running against our .NET Compact Framework on a Symbian mobile phone.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Community Server customization:</b> 
												Community Server is our pre-made and customizable ASP.NET based CSM that we used to develop the company web-site. I created several custom pages, CSModules, CSJobs and other custom work on our Community Server web-site. Some of the work included integrating our web-site with www.SalesForce.com. This was achieved using SalesForce's APEX API i.e. web service and SOQL (SForce Object Query Language). Furthermore all objects sent to SalesForce are queued in an MSMQ i.e. to prevent data loss.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Genesis:</b> 
												We had a tool that our customers used to bundle a .NET Compact Framework application into a .sis file in order to deploy it to a Symbian phone. The initial tool, was a console application. I was involved in the process of upgrading the application to integrate it with Visual Studio. We created a custom project type in Visual Studio, allowing the user to add a new Symbian SIS project and bundle executables and resource in it, as you would with a cab file for Windows Mobile. I also developed the initial version of the wizard that allowed for the capturing of information related to the SIS.

												<b>Bayhack DecAnalyzer:</b> 
												An application that gathers and saves records of deceased people in South Africa. The South African government does not have a website/system for searching for deceased people, instead it publishes a Government Gazette in PDF format of all deceased people and their estates. A law firm whose business relies on handling the estates for deceased people and claims wanted a system that automates the reading of these PDF files and saves the records into a database for searching and receiving notifications when people have died and their estates become available for lodging claims. The business case being that the lawyer only has a short time frame to make a claim against an estate once a person has died. If he misses that deadline he's not able to submit the claim and therefore he and his client will not be able to recoup any money that the deceased owed to them.

													Voice middleware server handling messages between Honeywell Vocollect Voice devices and the WMS. Due to Zebra and Vocollect (owned by Honeywell) becoming direct competitors, our customers were hesitant to use Zebra's TekSpeech middleware product to enable integrations between Vocollect voice applications and their WMS (Warehouse Management System). Zebra ultimately discontinued the TekSpeech product range. I suggested  and convinced  one of our voice customers to take on an R&D endeavour by developing and providing them with our own middleware server to replace TekSpeech. Pigeon Voice Server is now our own white label middleware product that I personally designed and developed and have now implemented at all of our clients' voice sites around the country. It works with  Honeywell Vocollect's proprietary message types (LUT & ODR) over TCP/IP (socket server) as well as over HTTP by providing a REST web service for the voice applications to consume.
													Pigeon Voice Website: developed a dashboard website in ASP.NET MVC to view statistics, devices and operators connecting as well as logs of every transaction going through the middleware.
													The server is a white label product that allows plugins to be developed for different WMS' that it connects depending on the business requirements.

													(User Designed Functions). The original product was developed using VBScript by one of the co-founders and Technical Director of 
													Datasmith. Since he was no longer with the company I was tasked with architecting and redeveloping the product using .NET and C#. 
													This is a reasonably large product being made up of several components including web services, configurators and the plugin itself. 
													Features are also available for customers to design/customise their Excel Insight functions within Excel. 
													All standard database queries using LINQ-to-SQL and custom queries using stored procedures. 
													Some of our customers include Burger King, Digistics, RCS, Old Mutual and many others.

													Whatsapp BOT framework for Kulula airline: this was an R&D endeavour from Nacelle to build a white label framework for creating Whatsapp BOTs. The first prospect client being Kulula airline, allowing passengers to check-in to their flights by having a two-way conversation with the Whatsapp BOT with all their flight details i.e. starting the check-in process, sending their name and flight number, selecting a seat etc.

											</div>
											<br>
											<br>
											<div class="inner" style="width: 100%;">
												<p>
													The framework had the following components:
													State Machine Generator & Runner: the framework was designed to be a white label product where we could design different process flows (dialog between BOT and user) without having to write code i.e. we would build up a decision tree/state machine by inserting data into a database e.g. creating the state machine's states, prompts, input takers, transitions etc. The framework would have a state machine runner that would execute the process flow setup in the database. I designed and completely developed this framework for creating and running a decision tree/state machine while my colleague implemented the CRUD data layer and logging of requests and responses. A future feature that I never got a chance to complete was creating Whatsapp BOT Studio application allowing us to design the work flows with a UI by dragging and dropping components of the decision tree/state machine. I only got the time to implement a POC of this using WPF for a desktop app. Database used in this framework was SQL Server with Entity Framework Core for interacting with the database.
													.NET Core Web API: we used Clickatell's ONE API for sending and receiving Whatsapp messages. Thus we needed a REST API to receive the callbacks from Clickatell i.e. when a user responded to a Whatsapp message and/or to be notified of a Whatsapp message having been delivered and read. The entire BOT was housed in a .NET Core Web API to receive the Clickatell call backs and make web requests back to the Clickatell ONE API. I developed the call backs REST actions and web requests i.e. integration with Clickatell

													An SMS based messaging system for creating scheduled repeat notifications. 
													It comes in two options: a desktop application developed in C# and Windows forms and a web application developed in C# and ASP.NET MVC. 
													Features include:
													<ul>
														<li><b>Receive Message</b>: customers (or organization members) can send messages to organisations by sending an SMS with a hashtag and the organisations identifier to the Repeat phone number.</li>
														<li><b>Manage Subscriptions</b>: when receiving an SMS, the person's cell phone number automatically gets saved as a subscriber to the organization and can be mananged from the website.</li>
														<li><b>Broadcast Messages</b>: this is essentially a bulk SMS feature.</li>
														<li><b>Messages Templates</b>: allows organisations to create and manage reusable message templates.</li>
														<li><b>Repeat Schedules</b>: schedules for repeat notifications can be generated by setting a start and end date, setting the days interval, the time at which the notifcation should be sent out and the message to be sent. For example: a schedule can be created to send John an SMS every 5 days at 18:00 for the next 90 days. Repeat notifications can be configured to be sent out automatically by the Repeat system, or you can manually send out each day's notifications one by one.</li>
														<li><b>Configure Work Days</b>: schedules can be generated by taking into account and excluding public holidays and other non-working days from the schedule i.e. if a repeat date falls on a non-working day (weekend or public holiday), its notification date can be rolled back to a working day. This feature can be enabled or disabled per repeat schedule.</li>
														<li><b>Daily Repeat List</b>: organisations receive daily emails listing the repeat entries for the day. This will allows them to plan out your day in terms of which subscribers (customers/staff members) are up for repeats for the day. The time of day at which they receive these emails can be configured in the organisation's profile settings.</li>
														<li><b>Automatic Notifications</b>: as repeat notifications come up the Repeat system can automatically send them out to the subscribers without requiring any manual user intervention.</li>
														<li><b>Reports for forecasting</b>: reports can be viewed and downloaded to see how many upcoming repeat entries are due for this week, month, year etc. This allows organisations to forecast the number of sales they can expect going forward i.e. how many customers will have upcoming repeats in the near future.</li>
														<li><b>REST API</b>: an integration REST API allows third party developers to integrate into the system.</li>

													An application that gathers and saves records of deceased people in South Africa. The South African government does not have a website/system for searching for deceased people, instead it publishes a Government Gazette in PDF format of all deceased people and their estates. A lawyer who's business relies on handling the estates for deceased people and claims wanted a system that automates the reading of these PDF files and saves the records into a database for searching and receiving notifications when people have died and their estates become available for lodging claims. The business case being that the lawyer only has a short time frame to make a claim against an estate once a person has died. If he misses that deadline he's not able to submit the claim and therefore he and his client will not be able to recoup any money that the deceased owed to them. 
													<br>
													<br>
													Components of the software:
													Console App that parses the PDF files and saves the records in a SQL Server database. It uses Adobe Services for splitting and extracting data out of the pDF files.  
													WCF REST and & MVC API: for querying data out of the database. 
													ASP.NET MVC Core Website: website for users to interact with the data, search for records, manage Debtors, Clients, Estates etc.

													Applications targeting Windows Mobile and Windows CE were installed on mobile devices by building CAB files containing the executable and dependencies. 
													However, each application required additional CAB files to be installed that it may have been dependent on e.g. .NET Compact Framework, hardware SDKs for interacting with the hardware etc.
													As part of installing an mobile app, one would need to install multiple cab files which was a very time consuming exercise.

													Psion Cabster is a utility I developed to bundle multiple CAB files into a single one in in order to speed up deployments. I made it available to all Psion customers

											<li> Generalist: I enjoy trying my hands at multiple things.</li>
											<li>Quality over quantity kind of person: have always prioritized quality over quantity, but due to external factors, sometimes this is just not possible e.g. budget constraints, difference of opinion with colleagues etc.</li>
											<li>Presentation skills: I have been complimented in the past (by a manager) that apparently I'm very good at doing technical presentations.</li>
											<li>Teacher: I have been complimented in the past (by a manager) that apparently I am very good at taking a complex concept and explaining it in a very easy to understand manner. I particularly enjoy explaining concepts to people who ask for my help; such as to my non-technical customers.</li>
											<li>Explicit & transparent communicator: I tend to be very straight forward and explicit when I express myself and I always mean what I say and say what I mean.</li>
